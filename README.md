### 👋 Hi, I am Andreas

## I take 📝 notes of the things I learn @ [andreasgompos.com](https://andreasgompos.com/).

## About me

- I see myself as a simple person. I like 🤸‍♀️ people, 🚵‍♀️ active life and 📚 learning.
- I grew up in 🇬🇷 Greece, enjoyed 🇳🇴 Norway for 5 months and I’ve been experiencing 🇬🇧 the UK for the past 7 years.
- I currently work as a machine learning engineer for a 🌯 food delivery company in London.
- Before that 👆, I studied chemical engineering in Athens and interned in two oil refineries.
- I have fulfilled my 9-month long compulsory 🪖 military service (mostly as a chemist in a lab 🤫).
- I enjoy deep conversations about abstract ideas and get excited when people break my mental models 🤯.
- still exploring… 🤷‍♂️
